It's simple lib I needed to make to simplify my projects which are based on woriking with files.  
It contains of few functions:

When creating object of class you should give it as an argument your file name on which you'll be woring (without extension - it's always txt)   

create_file  
open_file  
save  
print   
clear  
convert (string to int)  
load_line
